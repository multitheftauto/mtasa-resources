Welcome to TeamWars, a framework for team-, and class based modes.

GAMEPLAY

Gameplay depends on the mode defined within the map. Currently it supports the following mode(s):

CAPTURE POINTS (BASEWARS)

Each team has a starting point, and will have to capture one more capture points to win the round. When a point is captured, the spawn point can change.
You have to capture the points in order.

Green house: Defend this point
Red house: Capture this point

GENERIC COMMANDS

Change class: /select class
Change team: /select team

ABILITY COMMANDS
Reload: /reload

We suggest that you bind these commands to your favority key:

For example, press F8 to open the console, then type: bind r reload
This will bind /reload to your 'r' key

Happy gaming!
