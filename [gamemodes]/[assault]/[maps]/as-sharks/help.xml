Assault: Sharks v Humans

The aim of this slightly different assault map is for the attackers to reach all 10 objectives around the 'shark tank' while avoiding the shark players themselves.

The sharks job is to defend the objectives, and they can do this by 'eating' the attacking players by pointing their mouth over them.

There are numerous platforms around the tank which you can climb upon for safety, but ofcourse the sharks cannot do this. They can however survive underwater for an unlimited amount of time, and swim slightly faster than the attackers.
