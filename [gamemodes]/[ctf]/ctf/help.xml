<help>Capture the Flag

Capture any of the other teams' flag and retrieve it
to your own to receive points. Whichever team has the
most points by the end of the round wins it.

Rounds: Press F3 inbetween rounds to select a new team
        when the next round starts. If you choose not
        to select a new team, you will be automatically
        assigned to the next team on the list.
        Note: in maps that have spawnscreen disabled,
        pressing F3 would assign you to the team with
        the least players in it.

Spawnscreen: Use the arrow keys to navigate between teams
             and press Enter to join one.</help>
