FALLOUT
The object of the game is to stay alive by any means necessary. Jump across platforms and fight other players for dominance. Check your scoreboard to see your stats. The first player to win 10 games wins fallout. Note: Keep in mind that "W/L Ratio" on the scoreboard is calculated at the end of each game, not immediately after death.

Various options to change the way the game is played can be found in the options section at the top of the script.
